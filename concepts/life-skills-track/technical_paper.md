# IaaS :-

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) is a cloud service that helps organizations secure, manage, and scale their computing infrastructure by offering virtualized resources over the Internet.

## How IaaS works :-

- `On-Demand Access:`
  With IaaS, users can get to processing resources on-demand, allowing them to rapidly arrangement and deploy infrastructure components depending on the situation. This disposes of the requirement for forthright interest in equipment and empowers quick scaling to meet changing workload demands.

- `Pay per Billing Usage:`
  Iaas provide user to only pay as per the utilized resources. Users are charged on the actual use of their computing resource.

- `Scalibility:`
  It allows user to scale up and down as per their responsibility.

## Types of IaaS Services :-

- Virtual Machine
- Load Balancers
- Database
- Container
- Networking

## Advantages of IaaS :-

- It has more control than `SaaS` (Software as a Service) & `PaaS` (Platform as a Service).
- We have fully control over computing resources through access to `VMs` (Virtual Machines).

## Disadvantages of IaaS :-

    IaaS might incorporate administration intricacy, reliance on internet connectivity, security concerns, vendor lock-in, cost management challenges, execution fluctuation, and compliance and regulatory challenges.
